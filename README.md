# quick add eurs

lwc meant to be embedded on a carbon footprint record. it will display energy use records that are attached to the organizational asset but NOT attached to the CF you are on. You can then select the rows you want to create a related carbon footprint report item (junction object) and quick add a bunch of EURs to the CF you're looking at.

it's hilariously non-performant because i 1) can't write good soql and 2) dont know how to pass an sobject from javascript to apex.
